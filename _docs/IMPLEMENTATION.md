# WalletChan RPC Implementation

## Overview

`walletchan-rpc` is a local Ethereum JSON-RPC server that forwards wallet-mutating requests to a paired wallet session. The default transport is WalletConnect, and `--wallet-transport metamask-connect` uses MetaMask Connect. Its purpose is to let tools such as Foundry, viem, ethers, scripts, and AI agents talk to `http://127.0.0.1:4209` while every transaction or signature is still approved by the user in the wallet.

The RPC process never holds private keys. It owns only a wallet-transport client session and upstream RPC configuration. The paired wallet remains the signer and approval UI.

Default runtime:

- Local HTTP JSON-RPC: `http://127.0.0.1:4209`
- Skill/manual endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:4209/SKILL.md`
- Browser pairing QR page: `http://127.0.0.1:4209/qr`
- Health endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:4209/health`
- Session endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:4209/session`
- Default exposed chain: provided by CLI, commonly `--chain base`
- Wallet transport: `walletconnect` by default; `metamask-connect` optional
- WalletConnect project ID: env override or built-in public default

## Runtime Flow

1. `index.ts` parses CLI args through `parseCli()`.
2. Runtime chains are resolved from `--chain` and `--rpc <chain=url>` in `chains.ts`.
3. A wallet bridge is created from `--wallet-transport`: `WalletConnectBridge` for `walletconnect`, or `MetaMaskConnectBridge` for `metamask-connect`.
4. `startRpcServer()` starts the local HTTP server immediately. This lets `/health`, `/session`, `/pairing`, `/qr`, `/uri`, and `/SKILL.md` work while pairing is in progress.
5. `wallet.init()` creates a WalletConnect `SignClient` with metadata:
   - name: `WalletChan RPC`
   - URL: the local RPC URL
   - icon: WalletChan hosted icon URL
6. If a compatible stored session exists, it is reused.
7. If no session is available, the process creates a transport-specific pairing proposal, prints the URI, renders a terminal QR code, exposes the browser QR page at `/qr`, and tries to copy the URI to the clipboard.
8. The user pairs by scanning the QR code or pasting the URI in the selected wallet transport.
9. Once approved, the RPC can serve accounts, transactions, signatures, and ERC-5792 batches.

On `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM`, the HTTP server is closed and the in-memory wallet session handle is cleared. Stored sessions remain available for later reuse unless `--force-new-session` is used.

## Wallet Transport Selection

`--wallet-transport walletconnect` is the default and preserves the existing WalletChan/WalletConnect behavior.

`--wallet-transport metamask-connect` initializes MetaMask Connect with `@metamask/connect-evm`, `headless: true`, and the same configured chains/upstream RPC URLs. The RPC captures MetaMask Connect's `display_uri` event and serves that URI through the existing `/pairing` and `/qr` surfaces. This keeps MCP compatibility because clients still read `pairingUri`, `pairingUrl`, and optional QR image data from the same endpoints.

MetaMask Connect mode forwards standard EIP-1193 request shapes through `client.getProvider().request(...)`. It currently reports ERC-5792 batching as unsupported, so local `wallet_sendCalls` uses the existing sequential fallback.

Account state in MetaMask Connect mode is refreshed from provider `accountsChanged`, `client.accounts`, `client.selectedAccount`, and `client.getAccount()` whenever the RPC reads accounts. This handles MetaMask Mobile selected-account changes even if the provider event is missed. If a selected account still does not appear, `/pairing?transport=metamask-connect&account=0x...&forceRequest=true` calls MetaMask Connect `connect({ account, forceRequest: true })` to ask for that account explicitly.

The active transport can also be switched at runtime without restarting the RPC:

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:4209/pairing?transport=metamask-connect&force=true"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:4209/pairing?transport=walletconnect&force=true"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:4209/pairing?transport=metamask-connect&account=0x...&forceRequest=true"
```

`transport` accepts `walletconnect`, `wc`, `metamask-connect`, `metamask`, or `mm`. `force=true` clears the target transport's stored session before creating the new URI. Without `force=true`, switching to a transport with a reusable stored session can immediately report `connected: true`.

## WalletConnect Session Model

`WalletConnectBridge` requests the `eip155` namespace for every configured chain.

Base methods:

- `eth_sendTransaction`
- `personal_sign`
- `eth_signTypedData_v3`
- `eth_signTypedData_v4`

Batch methods, unless `--skip-batching` is set:

- `wallet_getCapabilities`
- `wallet_sendCalls`
- `wallet_getCallsStatus`
- `wallet_showCallsStatus`

Events:

- `chainChanged`
- `accountsChanged`

Session storage is scoped by host and port using a WalletConnect storage prefix and database path. By default the storage root is user-scoped under `/tmp/walletchan-rpc-uid-<uid>`; `WALLETCHAN_RPC_STORAGE_DIR` overrides the root, which is useful for persistent Docker volumes. This prevents different local RPC ports from accidentally sharing incompatible sessions and avoids root-owned temp directories breaking non-root MCP child processes. `--force-new-session` disconnects stored sessions and pairings before proposing a fresh session.

After approval, `validateSession()` ensures:

- every requested chain is approved
- every base wallet method is approved
- at least one EVM account is present

ERC-5792 methods are treated as a capability, not as a pairing requirement. If the wallet approves `wallet_sendCalls`, `wallet_getCapabilities`, `wallet_getCallsStatus`, and `wallet_showCallsStatus`, WalletChan RPC forwards batches natively. If those methods are missing, the session still connects and `wallet_sendCalls` uses the sequential fallback described below.

At runtime, `connected` means the bridge has a non-expired WalletConnect session with at least one approved EVM account. If the wallet deletes the session, expires it, sends an empty `accountsChanged` event, or updates the session to zero EVM accounts, the bridge clears the in-memory session.

When `walletchan-rpc` is running in an interactive terminal, a lost session prints a disconnect error and waits for the user to press Enter before generating a new pairing URI. This avoids surprising the user with a new QR/pairing URI every time a wallet is intentionally disconnected. Non-interactive callers, including MCP-managed child processes, should call `/pairing` to create a fresh URI without restarting the RPC process, or show `/qr` so the user can scan a browser QR page.

Wallet-mutating JSON-RPC requests fail with code `4900` when the wallet session is disconnected:

```json
{
  "code": 4900,
  "message": "Wallet session is disconnected. Pair a wallet again using /pairing or WalletChan MCP get_pairing_uri.",
  "data": {
    "code": "walletconnect_disconnected",
    "needsPairing": true
  }
}
```

Higher-level callers such as WalletChan MCP use that signal to return `status: "needs_pairing"` and, when possible, a fresh pairing URI.

## JSON-RPC Behavior

Local methods handled directly:

| Method | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `eth_accounts` | Returns approved wallet EVM accounts |
| `eth_requestAccounts` | Same as `eth_accounts`; pairing happens out-of-band in the CLI |
| `eth_chainId` | Returns active chain ID as hex |
| `net_version` | Returns active chain ID as decimal string |
| `web3_clientVersion` | Returns `WalletChanRPC/0.1.4` |
| `wallet_switchEthereumChain` | Switches the process-local active chain to a configured chain |

WalletConnect-forwarded approval methods:

| Method | Notes |
|---|---|
| `eth_sendTransaction` | Validates `from` against approved accounts, resolves optional tx `chainId`, forwards for user approval |
| `personal_sign` | Forwards on the active chain |
| `eth_signTypedData_v3` | Uses EIP-712 domain `chainId` when provided |
| `eth_signTypedData_v4` | Uses EIP-712 domain `chainId` when provided |
| `wallet_getCapabilities` | Forwards when approved; otherwise returns local sequential-fallback capabilities |
| `wallet_sendCalls` | Requires configured `chainId`; uses native ERC-5792 when approved, otherwise sequential fallback |
| `wallet_getCallsStatus` | Routes native status polling to the original bundle chain when known, or reads local sequential bundles |
| `wallet_showCallsStatus` | Same native bundle-chain routing as status polling; local sequential bundles return local status |

`personal_sign` should use standard WalletConnect/EIP-1193 params: `[message, address]`. Do not pass a protocol wrapper such as `{ "message": "..." }` as the message. Higher-level callers such as WalletChan MCP unwrap remote-MCP SIWE envelopes before calling `walletchan-rpc`, so the RPC can remain wallet-agnostic and forward the same request shape any WalletConnect wallet expects.

Read-only or unknown methods are forwarded to the current active chain's upstream RPC by `upstream.ts`.

Rejected methods:

- `eth_sendRawTransaction`: rejected because it bypasses WalletChan approval
- `eth_sign`: rejected as unsafe
- `eth_signTransaction`: rejected because it creates signed transactions outside the approval flow

## `wallet_sendCalls` Routing

When `wallet_sendCalls` is received:

1. `rpcHandler.ts` requires params to include a configured `chainId`.
2. If the connected wallet approved ERC-5792 batching, the original request is forwarded through the wallet transport.
3. The returned native bundle ID is recorded in `context.bundleChains`.
4. Later native `wallet_getCallsStatus` and `wallet_showCallsStatus` requests use that map to select the original chain instead of whichever chain is currently active.
5. If the wallet did not approve ERC-5792 batching, the RPC creates a local sequential bundle, sends each call as `eth_sendTransaction`, waits for that transaction receipt, then prompts for the next call.
6. Sequential fallback bundles return `mode: "sequential_fallback"`, `atomic: false`, ordered `transactionHashes`, per-call status, and local `wallet_getCallsStatus` support.

Sequential fallback preserves ordered dependent flows such as `approve + swap` for wallets without ERC-5792 support, but it is not atomic. If call 1 confirms and call 2 is rejected or fails, call 1 remains onchain. Wallets that support ERC-5792 continue to use native batching.

WalletChan extension owns the actual batch execution. For extension-side batch behavior, see `_docs/ERC5792.md`.

## Chain Configuration

`--chain <name-or-id>` is repeatable. Built-in aliases and default RPC URLs live in `chains.ts` and are copied from the extension registry. Numeric chain IDs are also supported if an upstream URL is provided:

```bash
walletchan-rpc --chain 43114 --rpc 43114=https://api.avax.network/ext/bc/C/rpc
```

`wallet_switchEthereumChain` only switches among chains configured at process start. It does not add new chains at runtime.

## Host Binding and HTTP Routes

By default the RPC binds to `127.0.0.1`. Use `--host <host>` or `WALLETCHAN_RPC_HOST` when the process must listen on another interface, for example `--host 0.0.0.0` inside an isolated Docker container whose port is published only to host loopback.

| Route | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | `POST` | JSON-RPC endpoint |
| `/rpc` | `POST` | JSON-RPC endpoint alias |
| `/health` | `GET` | Machine-readable status for MCP management |
| `/session` | `GET` | Connected session metadata and active chain |
| `/pairing` | `GET` | Returns a fresh transport-specific pairing URI when no valid session is connected |
| `/pairing?transport=metamask-connect&force=true` | `GET` | Switches the live wallet transport and returns the new pairing state |
| `/qr` | `GET` | Browser page with wallet-agnostic QR image, copy button, and auto-refreshing pairing state |
| `/qr?format=json` | `GET` | Machine-readable pairing page state, including QR data URL |
| `/uri` | `GET` | Compatibility alias for `/qr` |
| `/SKILL.md` | `GET` | Agent-facing runtime guide |
| `/skill.md` | `GET` | Case-insensitive convenience alias |

JSON-RPC batch arrays are supported. Empty JSON-RPC batches return `-32600`. Notifications return HTTP `204` when no response is required.

`/health` includes `accounts` and `transport`; an empty array with `connected: false` means the process is running but needs a fresh wallet pairing.

`/qr` is the most reliable QR surface for agents and terminal harnesses because it renders in a normal browser instead of depending on inline image support in an MCP client. The page labels the active transport, polls `/qr?format=json` every few seconds, reuses the current pending proposal, and updates automatically when a new URI is issued after disconnect or proposal expiry. The copy button writes the raw pairing URI to the clipboard. `/uri` remains as a compatibility alias.

## Environment

`WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` is optional. If omitted, the CLI uses WalletChan's default public WalletConnect project ID.

`WALLETCHAN_RPC_HOST` sets the default bind host for the HTTP server.

`WALLETCHAN_RPC_WALLET_TRANSPORT` sets the default wallet transport. Accepted values are `walletconnect` and `metamask-connect`.

`WALLETCHAN_RPC_STORAGE_DIR` sets the WalletConnect storage root. Use this in containers to keep session state in a persistent, writable volume owned by the process user.

## Security Properties

- No private keys are stored or loaded by `walletchan-rpc`.
- Wallet-mutating methods go through the selected wallet transport and require wallet approval.
- Raw transaction submission is blocked.
- Unsafe legacy signing methods are blocked.
- Upstream RPC URLs are used only for read/unknown forwarding.
- Wallet transport session reuse is explicit and can be reset with `--force-new-session` or `/pairing?transport=...&force=true`.
- Request timeout defaults to at least 300 seconds because wallet approvals can take user time.

## NPM Publishing

`@walletchan/rpc` is published from `walletchan-rpc`. For publishable RPC changes, update `CHANGELOG.md` from the package git diff, bump `package.json`, run `pnpm install --lockfile-only`, then build and dry-run from the repo root:

```bash
git log --oneline -- .
pnpm build
pnpm pack:dry-run
pnpm publish:dry-run
pnpm publish:npm
```

If WalletChan MCP depends on the new RPC behavior, also bump MCP's `@walletchan/rpc` version and publish `@walletchan/rpc` before `@walletchan/mcp`. Keep the package changelog and metadata in sync.

## Testing Checklist

For RPC-only changes:

1. Build: `pnpm build`
2. Start: `pnpm dev --chain base --force-new-session`
3. Pair a wallet with the printed `wc:` URI.
4. Check `curl http://127.0.0.1:4209/health`.
5. Check `eth_accounts` with `cast rpc --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:4209 eth_accounts`.
6. Test `wallet_switchEthereumChain` if chain routing changed.
7. Test a small `eth_sendTransaction`, a `personal_sign`, and an EIP-712 signature.
8. Test `wallet_sendCalls` if ERC-5792 behavior changed.
9. Test MetaMask Connect with `pnpm dev --chain base --wallet-transport metamask-connect --force-new-session`.
10. Test live transport switching with `/pairing?transport=metamask-connect&force=true` and `/pairing?transport=walletconnect&force=true`.

If a change affects extension transaction/signature handling through WalletConnect or WalletChan extension approval, test all WalletChan account types:

- Bankr API accounts (`impersonator`)
- Private key accounts (`privateKey`)
- Seed phrase accounts (`seedPhrase`)
